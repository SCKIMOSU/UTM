Dear Assoc. Prof. Dr. Asrul Izam Azmi,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sang-Chul Kim, and I am with the School of Software at Kookmin University, Republic of Korea.

Your contact information was kindly provided by Mr. Samuel Low Yu Hang.

We would like to kindly invite you to discuss potential collaboration between Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and Kookmin University, particularly regarding the establishment of an MoU and possible joint initiatives in the fields of software and computing.

Both institutions share strong academic and research capabilities in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Intelligent Systems. We believe there are significant opportunities for joint research, academic exchange, and program development.

Additionally, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share information on UTM programs that may align with Kookmin University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, such as robotics, mechatronics, smart manufacturing, or mobility-related departments/centers. This would help us explore expanded interdisciplinary cooperation between our institutions.

### Proposed Discussion Topics

1. MoU process between UTM and Kookmin University
2. Priority collaboration areas in Software and Computing
3. Information on UTM programs linked to Mechanical Engineering
4. Student exchange opportunities (short programs, joint projects, etc.)
5. Joint seminars, workshops, and research activities
6. Timeline and next steps for institutional cooperation

Your insights and experience will be invaluable to shaping a meaningful partnership between universities.

Thank you very much, and we look forward to your positive response.

Dear Prof Dr Sang-Chul Kim,

Thank you very much for reaching out, and for your kind interest in collaborating with Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).

From the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, our key strengths that align with your interests include robotics, mechatronics, and control engineering. Other areas of expertise include electronics and computer engineering, electrical power engineering, and communication engineering. Regarding the points you outlined, at the moment I can share with you student exchange opportunities at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Our faculty has been actively involved in inbound and outbound mobility activities such as academic visits, summer schools, and research internships. Attached are some examples of activities for inbound visits to our university. For your information, we have also sent our students to Korean universities for internships, including SNU and KAIST in the area of semiconductor research. Regarding joint seminars, workshops, and research activities, we have also conducted such programmes with international partners. I believe these initiatives will depend on the specific research areas shared between our institutions.For the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Intelligent Systems, UTM has strong programmes and research activities mainly under the Faculty of Computing. Since your main priorities are in software and computing, and you also requested information related to Mechanical Engineering, I can connect you with my colleagues from the Faculty of Computing and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, if you are okay with that.

Thank you once again for your kind invitation. I look forward to further discussion and to building a meaningful cooperation between Kookmin University and UTM.

Regards,

**Assoc. Prof. Ir. Ts. Dr. Asrul Izam Azmi**
